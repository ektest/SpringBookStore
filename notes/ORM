* Hibernate needs empty constructor (default constructor) 
must be exists in domain classes.

* 	@Id
Primary key. There must be id in the entity.

*	@GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO)
Auto generated primary key and strategy=GenerationType.
AUTO works for any database because some db have sequence or identity.

@PersistenceContext is like JDBC/Hibernate template
private EntityManager em;

META-INF and persistence.xml must be there.
